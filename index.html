            <div class = "paragraph">As more and more young Americans are choosing not to get married before moving in with their partner or having a child, it is important to consider the ways this might impact their future in terms of financial success. Receiving an education and maintaining a full-time job can significantly improve the likelihood of staying above the poverty line, but having a child presents a financial burden that can be harder for cohabiting couples to overcome than married couples. The success sequence, which you can read about <a href = "https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IFS-MillennialSuccessSequence-Final.pdf?x91208">here</a>, is an effective strategy for keeping adults out of poverty but struggles to capture the attention of younger generations who are not looking to follow a formula. The LIFE project aims to enhance this messaging by using playful data visualization to frame important life choices as game strategy.
